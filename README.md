# Health Sector Stock Portfolio Optimization  
**PAM Clustering & Mean–Semivariance Approach**

---

## 📌 Overview
This repository presents a **research-based data analysis project** developed from my undergraduate thesis in Statistics.  
The study focuses on **portfolio optimization of Indonesian health sector stocks** using clustering techniques and downside-risk–based portfolio construction.

The project integrates **statistical analysis, financial modeling, and data-driven decision making**.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Cluster health sector stocks using **Partitioning Around Medoids (PAM)**
- Reduce dimensionality using **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**
- Select representative stocks from each cluster
- Construct an optimal portfolio using the **Mean–Semivariance framework**
- Measure downside risk using **Value at Risk (VaR)** (Historical Simulation)
- Evaluate portfolio performance using the **Sharpe Ratio**

---

## 🛠️ Methods
- **Clustering:** PAM (Partitioning Around Medoids)  
- **Dimension Reduction:** PCA (manual computation)  
- **Return Calculation:** Log return  
- **Risk Measure:** Semivariance & Semicovariance  
- **Portfolio Optimization:** Matrix-based optimization  
- **Risk Evaluation:** Value at Risk (Historical Simulation)  
- **Performance Metric:** Sharpe Ratio (BI Rate as risk-free rate)

## 📐 Key Formulas
- Log Return  
  `R_t = ln(P_t / P_{t-1})`

- Mean–Semivariance Portfolio  
  `μ_p = Σ w_i μ_i`  
  `SV_p = wᵀ SV w`

- Value at Risk (Historical Simulation)  
  `VaR_α = Quantile(R_p, α)`

- Sharpe Ratio  
  `SR = (E(R_p) − R_f) / σ_p`

## 📂 Main Script
All analyses are implemented in a single R script:
